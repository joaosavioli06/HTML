#First HTML Websites My first HTML websites

In this repository are located my first two websites made in HTML (in one of them I used a little CSS).

Site 1 - I made this website in HTML and CSS in august 2022. At that time I was learning HTML and a little CSS, but I didn't go ahead with the course, because I didn't identify myself with the website creation aspect. The website is extremely simple, it was a little project to practice the new knowledge along with the course I was doing at the time.

I was doing the course on the Slackjeff platform: https://slackjeff.com.br

Site 2 - At the time I made this website (February - 2023), I was learning on a platform called DevPlay. This platform taught front-end concepts, and one of the challenges of the HTML part of the course proposed by the platform was to make this website. The site was completely made in HTML, in the style of websites from the 90s.

NOTE: both websites were made with the help of the courses taken at the time. Both websites were made with the support of the classes and in the style of learning by seeing someone programming and then replicating.
